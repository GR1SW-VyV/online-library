Feature: Write notes

  As a reader I want to make notes in a document to synthesize and facilitate my learning.

  Scenario: Take notes of a page of a document
    Given I am reading a document about "Lean Software Development"
    When I add a note with the text "Tomar en cuenta estos principios" in the page 10
    Then I should see the note in the notes section

  Scenario: Take notes of a document
    Given I am seeing the document information about "Ensayo sobre la ceguera"
    When I add an note with the text "Que interesante libro"
    Then I should see the note with the information of the document

  Scenario: Mark an annotation as favorite
    Given I am reading the book "Cien a√±os de soledad"
    And I want to take an important note
    When I mark the note as favorite
    Then I should see the note with the mark
